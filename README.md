# AI-eph

> Your AI-powered writing co-pilot.

AI-eph is a web application designed for novelists and world-builders. Unlike traditional text editors, AI-eph is more than just a place to write; it acts as an intelligent assistant that reads, understands, and analyzes your work to help you maintain consistency, track characters, and detect contradictions.

## üöÄ About The Project

Writers of long-form fiction often struggle with consistency. In which chapter did this character last appear? What was their eye color in the first book? Does this new plot point contradict something established earlier?

AI-eph was born to solve this problem, acting as the memory and analyst for your fictional universe.
