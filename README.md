## üöÄ About The Project

Writers of long-form fiction often struggle with consistency. In which chapter did this character last appear? What was their eye color in the first book? Does this new plot point contradict something established earlier?

AI-eph was born to solve this problem, acting as the memory and analyst for your fictional universe.
